Methodology:
I used ChatGPT to generate a structured a prompt describing how to build a Sokoban using the provided description.
Then I used the prompt inside Lovable (AI coding assistant) to generate the actual code.
After the code was generated, I reviewed, organized, and slightly refined it to ensure it worked correctly.

Challenges:
I didnâ€™t face major challenges while creating this project.
The prompt-based process worked smoothly, and the AI-generated code required only minimal corrections.
Most of my effort went into testing and confirming the Sokoban mechanics were correct.
