-The main challenge in this task was writing an accurate and complete prompt that correctly described how the frontend and backend should interact.

-Since the backend was responsible for fairness and timing across players in different locations, the prompt had to clearly specify how time synchronization works and how Socket.io events should flow between client and server.

-Ensuring that the generated frontend prompt correctly integrated all backend events (like join_game, lobby_update, game_start, and game_results) also required careful wording and structure.

-Overall, the challenge was communicating precise functionality through the prompt to make the AI output align perfectly with the intended game logic.
